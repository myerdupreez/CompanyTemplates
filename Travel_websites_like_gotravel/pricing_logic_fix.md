# 🔧 Chatbot Logic Fix: Pricing Questions Now Work Correctly

## ❌ **Previous Behavior (INCORRECT):**
```
Q: "How much does it cost for children?"
A: "Yes, children are welcome! However, it might be better to get more information through the contact form so we can recommend the best options for your family."
```
**Problem:** User wanted pricing information but got family-friendly confirmation instead.

## ✅ **New Behavior (CORRECT):**
```
Q: "How much does it cost for children?"
A: "For pricing details and customized quotes, please contact us at +27 82 775 7357 or send us a message through our contact form."
```
**Solution:** User now gets proper pricing information with contact details.

## 🎯 **What Changed:**

### **Logic Priority Update:**
1. **PRICING FIRST:** Any question with cost/price keywords → Pricing response
2. **FAMILY SECOND:** Family questions without pricing → Family response  
3. **TOURS + FAMILY:** Tour questions mentioning family → Family response

### **Code Changes:**
- Added pricing keyword detection **before** family logic
- Questions like "How much...", "cost", "price", "expensive" always get pricing response
- Family questions without pricing words still get family response

## 🧪 **Test Results:**

### ✅ **Pricing Questions (Now Working):**
- "How much does it cost for children?" → **PRICING** ✅
- "What are your family prices?" → **PRICING** ✅  
- "How expensive for a family of 4?" → **PRICING** ✅
- "Children's pricing?" → **PRICING** ✅

### ✅ **Family Questions (Still Working):**
- "Are the tours children friendly?" → **FAMILY** ✅
- "Can I bring my kids?" → **FAMILY** ✅
- "Family tours available?" → **FAMILY** ✅

## 🎉 **Result:**
Now when customers ask about pricing for children/families, they get the contact information they need to get actual quotes, while general family questions still get family-friendly responses.

**The chatbot now correctly handles the user's intent!** 🎯
