# Logo Placeholder

To add the Falcon Bus Service logo:

1. Save your logo image as `logo.png` 
2. Place it in the `public` folder of the React app
3. The logo will automatically appear on the homepage

The logo should be in PNG format and will be displayed at a height of 96px (24rem) with automatic width.

Current path for logo: `public/logo.png`

If no logo is found, a bus emoji (ðŸšŒ) will be displayed as a fallback.
